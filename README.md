# Topological Data Analysis of NBA Super Teams

## Proposal 

Inspired by Muthu Alagappan's topological data analysis on basketball statistics, where he identified 13 "new" positions in basketball, I aim to implement the Mapper algorithm in Python with various clustering methods. One particular clustering algorithm I wish to see the effectiveness of is the ToMATo (Topological Mode Analysis Tool) algorithm. Then, with the new positions I discover as features alongside the traditional basketball statistics, I want to analyze the performance of each team over the course of the regular season and post-season outcomes.

Specific teams I want to inspect are LeBron James’ teams throughout his career. The main goal of this exploratory data analysis would be to discover important traits of superteams. LeBron’s teams make the most sense to me to analyze, since he is given enough influence over management of these teams that he is essentially assembling the teams himself. Comparing the Lakers will hopefully yield interesting results.
